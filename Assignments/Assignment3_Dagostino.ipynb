    "#### Where is the data from? ​ <br>\n",
    "The [120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results - (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)] was shared on kaggle by user [rgriffin (https://github.com/rgriff23)] in 2018. I accessed the data on 2/8/2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How was it collected?​ <br>\n",
    "rgriffin scraped the data from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How was it extracted?​ <br>\n",
    "The R code used to [scrape the data - (https://github.com/rgriff23/Olympic_history/blob/master/R/olympics%20scrape.R)] is available. It was a one-time extraction with no updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "I downloaded the .csv data file from kaggle and converted it to a databale using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What program was used to clean the data?​ <br>\n",
    "The data was cleaned using R. They linked to the script they used to [wrangle the data -(https://github.com/rgriff23/Olympic_history/blob/master/R/olympics%20wrangle.R)].\n",
    "\n",
    "I used Python to then clean the data a bit further.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How was the data cleaned or transformed? Be specific.​ <br>\n",
    "I used Python to clean and transform the Olympic history dataset. I performed the following:\n",
    "- filtered to only contain rows where the NOC (Nantional Olympic Committee) is equal to USA\n",
    "- converted all coluimn names with lowercase with no spaces or special characters\n",
    "- removed 249 duplicate rows if they were identical\n",
    "- removed leading and trailing and whitespace characters from the name and event columns\n",
    "- removed the noc column as it was no longer necessary since only USA results remain\n",
    "- checked for outliers in the age column\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the units of the numeric data?​<br>\n",
    "- id - a unique integer for each athlete\n",
    "- age - measured in years\n",
    "- height - centimeters\n",
    "- weight - kilograms\n",
    "- year - 4 digit year\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What were the formulas used in column creation?​<br>\n",
    "No new columns were created by me for this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How is the data validated to ensure consistency?​<br>\n",
    "The Olympic games go back 120+ years, so I'd imagine that the data has been validated in numerous ways. Probably paper trails and in more modern games with digital information. I spot checked some numerical columns for the max and min range to see if there were any obvious outliers. If I were to append data I'd make sure the the gender, season, sport, event and medal fields were collected with some so of digial validation to ensure consistant data entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the definitions for the column names? Include all columns in your dataset.​<br>\n",
    "- id - a unique integer for each athlete\n",
    "- name - the athlete's name\n",
    "- sex - gender\n",
    "- age - year\n",
    "- height - centimeters\n",
    "- weight - kilograms\n",
    "- team - sub USA olympic team or organization\n",
    "- year - the year of the game\n",
    "- season - Summer or Winter\n",
    "- city - host city\n",
    "- sport - the sport\n",
    "- event - the event\n",
    "- medal - Gold, Silver, Bronze or NA\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If there are set variable options in your dataset, what are thier definitions? ​<br>\n",
