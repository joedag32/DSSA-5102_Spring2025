    "- We have explored a dataset. <br>\n",
    "- We have cleaned our dataset. <br>\n",
    "- We created a Github account with a repository for this class and included a metadata read me file about our data. <br>\n",
    "- We introduced general SQL syntax, queries, and applications in Python.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Now we will start the process of uploading our dataset into a database. There are many different ways to upload your .csv data into a database (.db file). Databases can be created in many open source applications, MySQL workbench, and even some websites can load your .csv data into a database...for a small fee. Instead of using an application, we are going to first create our database for our dataset from scratch in Python. On a much larger scale, data may be automatically uploaded to a database once it is aquired.<br>\n",

Most are VARCHAR and INTEGER, but I did decide to go with CHAR(1) for sex as that is either M or F, but what if there's a new designation in the future Olympics? I thought that gave me a bit of flexibility with the data going forward. For medal I decided to go with SET since there's only 4 values in that column (Gold, Silver, Bronze, NA). I haven't used SET in the past so I wanted to try a value I'm not familiar with.<br><br>\n",
