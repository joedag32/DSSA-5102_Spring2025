    "- We introduced general SQL syntax, queries, and applications in Python.<br>\n",
    "- Created our own databases from scratch using MySQL Workbench and Python with SQLAlchemy on our local server and locally on our machine.\n",

    "\n",
    "Background information:<br>Diamondback terrapins are New Jersey's only species of brackish water turtle. Brackish water has a mixture of both salt water and fresh water. They are commonly found in the back bays and saltmarshes of New Jersey. They can be found from Massachusetts to North Carolina. The females come ashore to nest in the summer months, while the males will not leave the water at all. Coming ashore to nest has consequences and risks for this species that include human-caused mortalities from vehicle strikes and natural predation. Although the males do not leave the water, human-caused mortality due to crab pots and ghost gear remain a huge threat to both sexes for this species of special concern. Up until 2016, terrapins were hunted during their winter hibernation for terrapin soup! <br>\n",
    "To further the concern for New Jersey's Diamondback terrapin, the species has temperature-dependent sex determination. Studies from research institutes and rehabilitation facilities, like Stockton University, have shown captive eggs that are incubated at a low temperature will produce all male terrapins and captive eggs that are incubated at a high temperature will produce all female terrapins. It is hypothesized that the determination of sexes may only vary by just a few degrees. If this is the case, how will the threat of climate change and the warming salt marshes impact our local population?<br><br>\n",
    "**Note:** New Jersey's subspecies of terrapin is the NORTHERN Diamondback Terrapin (_Malaclemys terrapin terrapin_) or (_Genus species subspecies_). We want to make sure we are selecting for the taxon_id of the NORTHERN Diamondback Terrapin. <br><br>"

    "#### In a New Jersey town (that will remain unnamed), there was a proposal to begin construction during the Summer of 2024 on a bike path that will run for 2.5 miles through the salt marsh. The construction has been delayed for one year and is expected to begin in the Summer of 2025. The bike path will be a raised (7ft) concrete pathway, or seawall, to accomodate for high and low tides to ensure that flooding is not an issue for the path. Water or wildlife (Turtles, fish, crabs, inverts, etc.) can not pass through or under the pathway. Birds can fly over the pathway. Construction is estimated to last four months. The goal of the pathway is to teach people about wildlife by walking through the man-made salt marsh trail. Railings will be placed on either side of the pathway to ensure human safety, but what about the safety of the wildlife?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local environmentalists and biologists are concerned with the proposed bike path, especially for the state's Diamondback terrapin population. Will this bike path create an obstacle that will force more females to cross the roads to lay their eggs? What about the eggs that are laid along the bike bath already from the year before? Will the nests be ruined in the process? In addition to the Diamondback terrapin, additional species also utilize this area for nesting and feeding like the Ipswich Sparrow, which is a subspecies of the Savannah Sparrow that has a very limited range. The saltmarsh serves as an important nursery ground for Atlantic Menhaden, the Mid-Atlantic ecosystem's \"Most Important Fish of the Sea.\"\n",
