    "I did a bar chart of the average weight of USA Olympians by year. I was expecting the athletes be a bit larger the closer we got to current day. While I'd say overall atheltes are larger, it wasn't as clear cut a trend as I as expecting to see. I think if I seperate by gender I might see a clearer distinction, I'll tab that as something to try next. Another thing that stood out is the absence of the Olympics during the first and second world wars."

    "Our next objective is to choose <b>ONE</b> of the datasets from our previous assignment to explore further. The datasets we have chose for Assignment #1 can be cleaned by practicing our Python skills. Depending on your data, and especially the size of it, it may be more beneficial to clean in a language you are comfortable working in already instead of cleaning our data with a new language like SQL. SQL may be needed for cleaning of databases that are very large or hundreds of terabytes in size. We will clean our datasets first before we attempt to load them into our SQL databases. </br>\n",
    "Not only is data everywhere, but it can also be messy. Messy data can originate in the data collection process, whether this is occurring with manual data entry and typos, or with outdated collection forms that hold multiple variables that mean the same thing. For example, while collecting data on marine mammals, it is important to note who the observer is. With Python and R, reading excel or csv files, these languages will take the same variable written as, \"Melissa Laurino\" and \"melissa laurino\" as two separate observers because they are case sensitive. However, this is not accurate because they are meant to be the same person within the observer column or category.</br>\n",
    "Clean data is important for consistency that leads to accurate results and analysis. If we are using our data to make informed decisions in our field, we need it to be clean. We do not want to omit rows that may make a difference to our dataset because they do not fit a certain criteria due to typos, but how much should the original dataset be altered? Depending on your field, there may be regulations and compliance standards regarding data quality. Protocols may state if the data does not read exactly how it should be, then it should be ommitted. </br>\n",
    "For our learning objectives in this class, we will clean our data. Our first assignment in our warehousing journey was important because it allowed us to gain a better understanding of a dataset that we personally did not collect. Now that we have that understanding, we can explore it in greater depth and clean it as necessary.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For Assignment #2, our objective is to clean one of the datasets explored above using Python to prepare for our future database from scratch. Include at a minimum:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The chosen dataset name, company/organization resonsible for data collection, the download link, and date of access.\n",
    "- Load neccessary packages and data (Only if you start a new session in Jupyter, not if you are continuing from above).\n",
    "- Make all column names lower case, contain no spaces, and no special characters (SQL will not like this otherwise).\n",
    "- *Make detailed comments with your code* <br>\n",
    "- *Record EVERYTHING ommitted and changed if necessary* <br>\n",
    "- Since we are exploring and learning without a specific organization policy, use your best judgement when ommitting records. If you have chosen to ommit data, please explain why.</br>\n",
    "- Save your new CLEAN data as a .csv file. \n",
    "\n",
